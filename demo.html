                            <p>This demo does not cover every single combination of classes, but it covers some possible scenarios, here's a description of all the switches available in the framework, you will also find a sweet table below.</p>
                            <ul class="content-list">
                                <li><a>CSL-START-[breakpoint]</a> <span>The layout behavior will be enabled at the breakpoint stated in the class, before that each column will occupy 100% of its parent width.</span></li>
                                <li><a>CSL-STOP-[breakpoint]</a> <span>It stops the layout behavior at the breakpoint stated in the class.</span></li>
                                <li><a>CSL-WRAP-[breackpoint]</a> <span>Works only on selected layouts, this class will wrap the layouts on 2 rows starting at the breakpoint stated in the class</span></li>
                                <li><a>CSL-FLIPWRAP</a> <span>When the layout is wrapped in 2 rows, this class simply flip the position of the rows on the stack, no need to state a breakpoint.</span></li>
                            </ul>

I could use you. Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.</p><p>Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.</p>

That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. Leia! Leia's my sister. Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.</p><p>The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy. Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this. What's he saying? He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.</p><p>Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. There's still good in him. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. I can't do it, Ben. You cannot escape your destiny. I can't kill my own father. Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. Yoda spoke of another. The other he spoke of is your twin sister. But I have no sister. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. </p><p>It's a trap!</p><p>I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. Yoda will always be with you. Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. </p>
